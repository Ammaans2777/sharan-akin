    <h2>💌 A Love Letter from Appu</h2>
    <p style="max-width: 600px; margin: auto; line-height: 1.6">
      My dearest Chakare,<br /><br />
      On this beautiful day, I just want to remind you how truly special you are to me. Every moment with you feels like a dream, and every day I spend loving you is a blessing. Even with oceans between us, you are always right here in my heart.<br /><br />
      You inspire me, you calm me, and you make life so beautifully worthwhile. I can't wait to spend many more birthdays by your side — laughing, loving, and living our dream together.<br /><br />
      Happy 22nd, my love. Here's to forever. 💞<br /><br />
      Yours always,<br />
      Appu

    <h2>🌸 10 Reasons Why I Love You</h2>
    <p><em>(A letter from my heart to yours)</em></p>
    <div class="reasons">
      <div class="reason">
        <img src="reason1.jpg" alt="Reason 1" />
        <p><strong>1. You always find time—for us.</strong><br />No matter how packed your day is with work, classes, or life, you still make time to hear my voice, to ask me how I’m doing, and to remind me I matter. That effort? It means the world to me.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="reason">
        <img src="reason2.jpg" alt="Reason 2" />
        <p><strong>2. You love so deeply, it humbles me.</strong><br />The way you care—not just about me, but about everyone around you—shows me what real love looks like. You’re generous, thoughtful, and full of so much light.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="reason">
        <img src="reason3.jpg" alt="Reason 3" />
        <p><strong>3. You’re the gentlest soul I’ve ever met.</strong><br />You feel things so purely. Even the tiniest gesture can move you. That softness is rare—and I fall in love with it every day.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="reason">
        <img src="reason4.jpg" alt="Reason 4" />
        <p><strong>4. You treat my family like they’re yours.</strong><br />You ask about my parents. You’re always kind and respectful toward them. And the way you care for my little brother like he’s your own—it melts my heart. You’re already part of my family, whether you know it or not.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="reason">
        <img src="reason5.jpg" alt="Reason 5" />
        <p><strong>5. You’re my safest place.</strong><br />No matter what I’m going through, just hearing your voice calms me. You know how to make my chaos feel calm without even trying.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="reason">
        <img src="reason6.jpg" alt="Reason 6" />
        <p><strong>6. You make me feel chosen.</strong><br />From that first time we met at the bar, something just clicked. Since then, not a single day has passed without us talking. That consistency, that loyalty—it’s what makes me feel truly loved.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="reason">
        <img src="reason7.jpg" alt="Reason 7" />
        <p><strong>7. You’re my best friend and my favorite person.</strong><br />I can laugh with you, cry with you, dream with you. You’re the person I’d want to talk to at 3 a.m. or go quiet with on a lazy Sunday afternoon.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="reason">
        <img src="reason8.jpg" alt="Reason 8" />
        <p><strong>8. You make love feel easy and real.</strong><br />With you, love isn’t complicated games or confusion. It’s soft, patient, and full of effort. You make it feel natural to love and be loved.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="reason">
        <img src="reason9.jpg" alt="Reason 9" />
        <p><strong>9. You inspire me every day.</strong><br />The way you move through life with compassion, strength, and grace—it pushes me to be better. Not for you, but with you.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="reason">
        <img src="reason10.jpg" alt="Reason 10" />
        <p><strong>10. I love you… because you’re you.</strong><br />All of you. The girl who smiles even when she’s tired. The girl who holds me up even when I don’t ask. You, just as you are, are everything I’ve ever wanted.</p>
        <p style="margin-top: 30px;"><strong>You’re my home. My heart. My person. And I can’t wait for the day we get to wake up next to each other without needing a phone screen between us.</strong></p>
